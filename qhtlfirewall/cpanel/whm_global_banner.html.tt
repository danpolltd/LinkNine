[%# QhtLink Firewall - WHM Global Banner include
  #%]
[%# This include renders a small status badge in the WHM header using
   # an official template include slot: /var/cpanel/customizations/whm/includes/global_banner.html.tt
   # It fetches a lightweight JSON from our CGI and maps to a badge.
   # Safe to include multiple times; no JS errors on failure. %]
