Key Features
QhtLink Suite provides a multi-layered approach to server security, incorporating several critical functionalities:

Failure Tracking: QhtLink Suite is designed to detect repeated failed login attempts and automatically block the offending IP addresses. This feature is vital in mitigating brute-force attacks and unauthorized access attempts.
Process Monitoring: It identifies and mitigates potential compromises by continuously monitoring running processes on the server. This helps in detecting malicious processes or unauthorized software execution.
Port Management: The suite allows for precise management of open and closed ports, ensuring that only necessary services are exposed to the network. This minimizes the attack surface and enhances overall security.
Versioned and Auditable Rules: QhtLink Suite enables the application and enforcement of consistent security settings through versioned and auditable rules. This provides transparency and accountability in security configurations.
Easy Integration: Designed for easy integration into hosting control panels like cPanel, simplifying deployment and management for server administrators.
